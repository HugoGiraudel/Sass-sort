Sass sort
=========

Here are a couple of ways to sort values (including strings) in Sass (~> 3.3).

**Disclaimer!** While it can be useful to sort numbers in Sass in case of the making of a modular scale or something, it is rarely the case for strings. The main idea behind this repository is to push Sass' syntax to its limit. Long story short: *because we can*.

## Available algorithms

* [Bubble sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Selection sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
* [Quick sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [Shell sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort)
